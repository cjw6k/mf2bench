## Prerequisites
1. [ministat](https://github.com/codahale/ministat) - check your package manager
2. [cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) (optional) - check your pacakge manager

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to a local folder: `git clone https://code.cjwillcock.ca/experiments/mf2bench.git ~/mf2bench && cd ~/mf2bench`.
2. Run the preflight check: `./preflight-check.sh`.
   * (optionally) without using terminal color: `MONO=1 ./preflight-check.sh`
3. Add source URLs for the HTML to use for benchmarking.
   * To use the HTML from cjwillcock.ca: `mkdir var/sources/cjwillcock.ca`
   * Replace URL path separators with a triple underscore.
     * To use the HTML from cjwillcock.ca/now: `mkdir /var/sources/cjwillcock.ca___now`.
   * Refresh the source samples: `./refresh-sources.sh`.
4. Run the benchmarks, specifying the number of samples per-source per-parser as the only parameter.
   * To parse each source ten (10) times with each parser: `./mf2bench 10`.
     * If the samples parameter is left out, mf2bench will use a default of three (3).
     * (optionally) without using terminal color: `MONO=1 ./mf2bench`
